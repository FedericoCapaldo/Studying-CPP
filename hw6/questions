QUESTIONS:

1. how to implement the LinkedList for Picture. should be a seprate class?
  But the hw6.zip does not contain any other file
nested ShapeLinkedList class



2. Which class should have add(Shape * sp) {};
Picture.h



3. the only descuctor i should build is of the picture class, not the one of circle , triangle or SHAPE.
yes, remember to remove the Shape first, move to next node, and also delete this LinkedListNode itself



4. Should I create the object as pointer in order to add it to the Picture object (so the list) ?
  e.g. Triangle * firstTrianle = new trianlge(4,5, "firstTriangle"); OR Triangle firstTrianle(4,5, "firstTriangle");
Do the first, pointer.



5. Is it ok the way I have passed the default 0 inside the concrete shapes? (question because of capital warning in hw)
yes it is
